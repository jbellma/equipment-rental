Equipment Storage and Rental.

The goal of this project is to help me put into practice the core concepts learned in Python, by implementing a real and practical case. A basic management software to help businesses manage their inventory, orders and customers.

The project will be divided into three phases in order to simplify the task into a series of logical and manageable steps.

Phase 1: Main program menu and data entry.

Phase 2: Structuring the code into functions and data validation.

Phase 3: Catalog of products, services and contracts.
