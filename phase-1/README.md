### Introduction
The company ***YOURCRANE.com*** is a leading company that provides modern lifting products and services. Its main activity is the rental of fixed and mobile cranes
with operator. Given the success of the company in recent months, they have asked me for help in order to manage their equipment rentals. A software application must be developed to recognize and respond to the company's needs.

The project will be divided into three ***phases*** in order to simplify the task into a series of logical and manageable steps:

- Phase 1: Main program menu and data entry.

- Phase 2: Structuring the code into functions and data validation.

- Phase 3: Catalog of products, services and contracts.
