## <p align="center">PHASE 3</p>


### Introduction

It should be understood ***phase 3*** as a continuation of the second phase. Unlike ***phase 2***, this phase requires the use of data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.) whenever necessary. Libraries won't be used.

***Phase 3*** adds to the code delivered in ***Phase 2*** the use of data structures for storage of information in the program and its management.

### Phase 2: Tasks to be Completed

- Task 1: The code will be completely error-free and capture errors with exceptions.

- Task 2: To prevent errors, data will be kept in lower case. ***NID*** will be written in all caps when stored. 

- Task 3: Clients and lifting supplies will be arranged and stored appropriately.

- Task 4: The application will allow users to add new rental records for lifting equipment and save them in a  dictionary of lists.

- Task 5: Data on lifting devices, customers, and rentals will always be displayed as indicated.

All of these features can be broken down into the ***four*** basic duties listed below.

### TASK 1: Robust Code

Code must be modified to ensure that it never throws unexpected runtime errors but rather detects all potential issues, primarily by user input. The following figure provides instances of various wrong NIDs along with solutions.

### TASK 2: Data Storage in Lower Case

The program will always store all input as lowercase character strings in program variables, allowing users to enter data in both uppercase and lowercase.

For instance, the user can enter the brand name ***PALFINGER*** Â as ***"PalfINger,"*** and the program will still presented as a proper value and store it in lowercase.

FIGURE NEEDED

Only one exception applies. The ***NID*** letter will be saved using the standard format for this data, which is a capital letter. If the user types it in lowercase, the program will change it and store it with the uppercase character as we have stated.

### TASK 3: Storage of Lifting equipment and Customer Information

The program will enable the storage of numerous lifting devices and costumers (no limit).
Equipment or customer data can be modified at any moment.
