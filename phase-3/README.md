## <p align="center">PHASE 3</p>


### Introduction

It should be understood ***phase 3*** as a continuation of the second phase. Unlike ***phase 2***, this phase requires the use of data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.) whenever necessary. Libraries won't be used.

***Phase 3*** adds to the code delivered in ***Phase 2*** the use of data structures for storage of information in the program and its management.

### Phase 2: Tasks to be Completed
- Task 1: The code will be completely error-free and capture errors with exceptions.

- Task 2: To prevent errors, data will be kept in lower case. NID will be written in all caps when stored. 

- Task 3: Clients and lifting supplies will be arranged and stored appropriately.

- Task 4: The application will allow users to add new rental records for lifting equipment and save them in a   dictionary           of lists.

- Task 5: Data on lifting devices, customers, and rentals will always be displayed as indicated.

All of these features can be broken down into the ***four*** basic duties listed below.
